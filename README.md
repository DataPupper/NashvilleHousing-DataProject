# NashvilleHousing-DataProject
As the name suggests this is an ETL and data cleaning project (that makes up 70-90% of thr data analyst job).
This is a solo experimental project with a systematic SQL code that in some places (where applicable) shows alternatives to solving a problem in more than 1 way.
